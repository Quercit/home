#Study

  2017 — 2018 
  [Research Methods in Psychology](https://www.gla.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/psychologicalscienceresearchmethodsof/) at University of Glasgow 
  
  
  2013 — 2017 
  [Social & Organizations Psychology](http://didattica.unipd.it/off/2016/LT/PS/PS1085) at University of Padua, Italy.


  In September 2017 I obtained my BA degree in Social Psychology at University of Padua with an experimental thesis on   2D-3D face recognition, result of the work carried out in the [FaceLab](facelab.org). 
  
  The research was aimed to compare third-party kinship judgments using 2D and 3D face stimuli, you can find more about this study on the [pre-registration page](https://osf.io/8xnt9/) or you can have a look at the [research Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LZNEvrSnp3i1FI-tLeIIBoweJbI3FekF/view?usp=sharing)
