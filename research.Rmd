#Experiments

###• 2018
[Research Methods in Psychology](https://www.gla.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/psychologicalscienceresearchmethodsof/) MA degree at University of Glasgow.
  
  My Master's project is a methodological study that investigates the perception of relatedness of real and "virtual" siblings in both 2D and 3D faces.
  
  Many previous studies on the effect of kinship cues on prosocial and sexual attitudes have employed morphologically manipulated faces, on the assumption that a high similarity between two faces can increase the perceived relatedness (Maloney & Dal Martello, 2006).

  To test whether this morphing procedure results in faces that are actually perceived as related to the original, we compare third-party judgments of relatedness of “virtual” and real siblings. 

  We are also testing whether 3D visualisation influences these judgments.

  
###• 2017
[Social & Organizations Psychology](http://didattica.unipd.it/off/2016/LT/PS/PS1085) BA degree at University of Padua, Italy.

  In September 2017 I obtained my BA degree in Social Psychology at University of Padua with an experimental thesis on   2D-3D face recognition, result of the work carried out in the [FaceLab](facelab.org). 
  
  The research was aimed to compare third-party kinship judgments using 2D and 3D face stimuli, you can find more about this study on the [pre-registration page](https://osf.io/8xnt9/) or you can have a look at the [research Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LZNEvrSnp3i1FI-tLeIIBoweJbI3FekF/view?usp=sharing)
  
###• 2016
  At University of Padua, I assisted Prof.s Peter Kramer & Paola Bressan in a cognitive experiment that investigated the effects of autistic and schizophrenic tendencies, exposure to certain colours, and presentation time on particular kinds of visual illusions.
