#Reseach Interest

  I obtained my BA degree in Social Psychology at University of Padua in September 2017, with an experimental thesis on   2D-3D face recognition result of the work carried out in the [FaceLab](facelab.org). I am now working again in the same Lab for my MSc in Research Methods of Psychological Science, within the KINSHIP project.

  My current research focuses on the understanding of how humans recognise their kin. More specifically, what kind of cues in the face let others to assest the relatedness between two individuals.
